Brooklyn's finest, Biggie Smalls in the place,
Flow so smooth, lyrics laced with grace.
From street corners to fame, I paved the path,
The Notorious B.I.G., forever a rap legend's aftermath.

I'm the king of rap, lyrical prowess,
Biggie Smalls, leaving tracks in the consciousness.
From coast to coast, my rhymes indisputable,
A rap icon, forever I'll be immutable.
